   * TODO(@tjjfvi): a factory for generic call factories?
   *
   * One limitation: we can't attach doc comments to params.
   * Perhaps this factory should be constrained to be unary, where the param must be an object?
   * This would force a situation in which doc comments don't need to be attached to params,
   * as they can be attached to props instead.
   *
   * How would this look? Maybe...
   *
   * ```ts
   * export const f = generic((def) => {
   *   return def(<Props extends { val: string | number }>(
   *     props: Props,
   *   ): Props["val"] => props.val);
   * });
   * ```
